# Classical Elements ¾: Focus on energy, light, or transformation. Map heat, wildfires, energy consumption, population density at night, or volcanic activity.

Day 15, focusing on the element Fire, immediately caught my interest because it prompted reflection on energy consumption. I was also curious to experiment with **kepler.gl** to explore Uganda’s Census findings. When I connected fire with cooking and energy with the electricity grid, the theme felt like a perfect match.

Uptake of cleaner cooking energy is central to achieving SDG 7—ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Extensive research has documented the harmful effects of polluting fuels, yet Uganda’s electric-cooking landscape remains in its early stages due to a mix of political, technical, and social constraints.
