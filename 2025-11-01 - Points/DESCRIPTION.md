1 dot = 1 dog

Back in April, lots of students in my lab took a day to study dog as data---that was our #dogathon. New York City has a lot of cool datasets publicly available, including this dog licensing data. We focused a lot on dog names and breeds, this is yet another fun map I wanted to create just to remind myself of all sorts of data we have available.
