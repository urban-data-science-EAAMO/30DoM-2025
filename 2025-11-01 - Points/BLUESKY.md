For our first map, we had to visualize spatial data as dots. @gsagostini worked on a dot density map showing dog density in New York City.

1 dot = 1 dog

New York City has a lot of cool datasets publicly available, including this dog licensing data. We focused a lot on dog names and breeds, this is yet another fun map I wanted to create. In our #dogathon thread, you can find more maps (and plots (and dog park simulators))."
