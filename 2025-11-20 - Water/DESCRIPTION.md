# Water

**Date**: 2025-11-20

**Description**:

Arsenic and Cadmium consumption are linked to diseases like breast cancer, but is sometimes ingested through drinking water. This map of Arsenic and Cadmium levels in Mexico's water shows non-trace concentrations of Total and Soluble Arsenic and Cadium throughout the state. Points are colored by the presence of high amounts of contaminants, and sized by their relative concentration. 

This work (along with Day 11 on Air) are part of our data exploration in an ongoing collaboration continuing some of the work from the 2024 EAAMO social hackathon in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.
