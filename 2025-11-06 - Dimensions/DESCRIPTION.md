# Exploring ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity: Immersive 3D Mapping for Design & Planning

For Day 6, I wanted to explore CAD and design tools. I'm currently taking the Augmented and Virtual Reality course taught by Professor Harald Haraldsson at Cornell Tech, where I've been building experiences similar to Gravity Sketch, a VR design tool, in Unity from scratch. Next, I wanted to step into a designer's shoes and see what tools are already available to them,so I chose to set up ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity and explore their sample project. This includes 15 features for spatial analysis and design: the third-person controller lets you navigate cities as a character, while the viewshed analysis calculates sight lines from any point—I tested this from the Empire State Building's observation deck. While these immersive tools are compelling, they seem quite nascent. I do feel that the interaction techniques could be more intuitive for city planners, urban designers who may not be well-versed with Unity perhaps using Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics as a framework to make the UI/UX user-friendly. That said, this is just a sample project, and it's pretty cool to see spatial data move from static 2D maps into walkable environments where city planners, architects, and designers get to experience urban changes at human scale before they're built.
