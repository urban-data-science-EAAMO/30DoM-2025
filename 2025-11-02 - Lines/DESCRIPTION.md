# Minard-style flow map of Roosevelt Island Tramway Ridership (Jan 2019-Dec 2020)

I selected the **“Flow Lines”** theme to reinterpret Charles Minard’s seminal map of Napoleon’s disastrous 1812 Russian campaign. As a resident of Roosevelt Island, I was interested in exploring tramway ridership given the recent surge as the tram has become a popular tourist attraction. Although I initially sought to analyze the most recent ridership data, I couldn't easily find this information. Instead, I chose to focus on pre- and post-pandemic trends, using the MetroCard fare types to infer distinctions between resident and tourist ridership.  

The data was sourced from the [**MTA NYCT MetroCard History: 2010–2021**](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-NYCT-MetroCard-History-2010-2021/v7qc-gwpn/about_data) dataset. One incongruity I observed was the drop in tramway ridership records from December 2020 onwards, with tram data entirely missing from newer MTA datasets—a notable gap in data continuity.  

I spent a lot of time on the visual design. With a background in data science, my training has emphasized building functional maps. So, I decided to take the #30DayMappingChallenge as an opportunity to experiment with cartographic aesthetics. Apart from Charles Mindard, I also drew inspiration from cartographer **John Nelson** for visual storytelling. That is why I have embedded silhouettes from the **1879 Taylor Map**, to anchor this modern ridership narrative within New York City’s enduring transit history.
