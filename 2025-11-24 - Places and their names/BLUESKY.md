For Day 24 of the challenge, @pendulating riffed off of the 'Places and their Names' theme to map global 'gossip' patterns using a world-wide news article dataset and the Unicode CLDR project. This visualization is built atop 415,000 news articles that were randomly sampled from digital news providers in 55 'ego' countries between 2015-present, courtesy of Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge's Responsible AI Group. Instances of country mentions in each article are qualified by CLDR, which has compiled names of 257 countries as expressed differently in 186 languages; this ensures that my analysis is not English-centric.

I used flashtext, a high-performance keyword search algorithm, to scan articles and count these mentions. This allows us to map, for example, how often French newspapers mention "Allemagne" (Germany) or how often Chinese outlets mention "美国" (USA). I've also tried to manually verify the accuracy of results, removing instances like 'CAN' (the ISO code for Canada) that inflated counts via equivalence after tokenization with the English verb 'can'.
