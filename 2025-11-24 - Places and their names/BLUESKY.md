For Day 24 of the challenge, I riffed off of the 'Places and their Names' theme to map global 'gossip' patterns, using a world-wide news article dataset and the Unicode CLDR project, which provided names of 257 countries as expressed differently in 186 languages; this ensures that my analysis is not English-centric. This visualization uses 415,000 news articles randomly sampled from digital news providers in 55 'ego' countries between 2015-present, courtesy of Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge's Responsible AI Group.

I used flashtext, a high-performance keyword search algorithm, to scan articles and count these mentions. This allows us to map, for example, how often French newspapers mention "Allemagne" (Germany) or how often Chinese outlets mention "美国" (USA). I've also tried to manually verify the accuracy of results, removing instances like 'CAN' (the ISO code for Canada) inflating counts via the English verb 'can'.
