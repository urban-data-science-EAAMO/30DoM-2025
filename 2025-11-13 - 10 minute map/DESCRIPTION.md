# Indoor Air Quality Complaints in NYC

For Day 13 of the #30DayMapChallenge, I used **Marauders**, an AI-powered mapping tool, to make a heatmap of indoor air quality complaints across New York City. The dataset is originally sourced from the city's 311 service requests. I built this map during the **NYC Climate Tech Week Hackathon** to put together a quick visualization of variances in air quality complaints across the five boroughs. The map also illustrates how quickly AI tools can turn open data into visual stories -- all I had to do was upload the dataset, and Marauders handled the rest! You can also chat with the map to understand the underlying data and attributes. Cartography has come a long way...
