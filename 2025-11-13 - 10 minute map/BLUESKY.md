Day 13 of the #30DayMapChallenge: I used Marauders, an AI-powered spatial intelligence tool, to create a heatmap of indoor air quality complaints in NYC using data from the city’s 311 dataset. All it took was downloading the dataset from NYC Open Data and uploading it to Marauders — cartography has come a long way with AI!
