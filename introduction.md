# 30 Days of Maps 2025

Welcome to my cartographic journey through the **30 Day Map Challenge**. Throughout November 2025, I created one map each day, exploring different techniques, datasets, and visualization approaches.

From points and lines to complex data challenges and experimental projections, each map represents a unique exploration of spatial data and cartographic design.

## About This Collection

The challenge includes 30 themed prompts:
- **Week 1**: Foundations - Points, Lines, Polygons, Hexagons, A Journey
- **Week 2**: Exploration - Raster, Vintage, HDX, AI Only, Pen & Paper
