Here is a visualization of the iMapInvasives New York dataset alongside the water, road, rail, and urban centre layers from the Natural Earth dataset. You can see invasive species are correlated with these elements, due to a combination of human activity introducing invasive species and more observations coming from areas of human activity. This dataset is used to prioritize invasive species treatment.
