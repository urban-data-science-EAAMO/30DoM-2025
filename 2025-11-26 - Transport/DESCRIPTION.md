This map shows MBTA bus routes as of fall 2025. In an attempt to show the growth of the bus system over time, each route is colored based on the earliest known year in which a direct precusor route ran a bus. These bus routes have been inherited from various older private and public bus companies, converted from street cars or trackless trollies, and created whole cloth based on arising needs. Together they represent the complex and evolving history of bus transportation in Greater Boston. The dates come from two sources: the record of changes from 1964-2025 maintained by Jonathan Belcher (http://roster.transithistory.org/MBTARouteHistory.pdf) and Thomas Humphrey's book on the development of the MBTA's bus network (http://roster.transithistory.org/MBTABUSDEV.pdf). The shape files are sourced from MassGIS (https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-mbta-bus-routes-and-stops).
