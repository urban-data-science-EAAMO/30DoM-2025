Short: For Day 18, I explored the idea of turning fantasy map-making using rice digital to form tactile, fantasy terrains. #30DayMapChallenge

In this project I created a generative terrain builder that transforms virtual scatterings of rice-shaped polygons into coastlines, heightmaps, and fully shaded 3D landscapes. Inspired by the handmade maps created by outlining real piles of rice, the system replaces traditional noise-based terrain generation with a physical analogy: grain density becomes elevation. Thousands of grains are scattered in clustered patterns, merged into a landmass outline, converted into a smooth density field using KDE, and blended with edge-fading to mimic coastal shelves. Gaussian filtering adds coherence, while elevation bands and soft lighting produce naturalistic terrain with sand, grass, rock, and snow. The result is a unique, organic island each run: procedural, tactile, and shaped by the chaos of virtual rice.
